 Dummy data generator explanation : 

1. Connects to my local PostgreSQL database called "health".
2. Gets the current time and sets a start time 24 hours earlier.
3. Loops through 5 fake users: "1", "2", "3", "4", "5".
4. For each user:
 - It simulates 1 record every minute from start to end time (24 hours).
 - Around 5% of records are skipped randomly to simulate missing Apple watch data.
5. For each minute, it generates:
 - Heart rate (normal range between 60–110)
 - Steps per minute (more active during daytime 7:00–21:00)
 - and other metrics as well.
6. The data is inserted into the "health_data" table using "psycopg2" (PostgreSQL Python connector).
